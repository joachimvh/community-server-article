### Components.js
[Components.js](cite:cites componentsjs) is a Dependency Injection framework built specifically
for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) projects.
It is non-invasive in that all of its configurations happens outside the source code in external configuration files,
which describe how classes are linked to each other and which parameters they require.
These descriptions are done in RDF, which means that those configuration files are valid RDF serializations.
Usually [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) is used.
