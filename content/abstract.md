## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
The Solid project aims to empower people
by giving them back control over their own data,
creating aÂ separation between applications and data.
The goal is an environment with clear interoperability
between all solutions that adhere to the defined specification.
In essence,
Solid is a standards-driven way to extend the Linked Data vision
from public to private date, and everything in between.
<!-- Need         -->
Multiple implementations of the Solid Protocol exist,
but due to the still evolving nature of the ecosystem,
there is a strong need for an implementation that enables research into new features
and allows developers to quickly set up varying development environments.
<!-- Task         -->
To meet these demands,
we have created the Solid Community server,
a modular server that can be configured to suit many needs.
<!-- Object       -->
In this article, we give an overview of the server architecture,
and how it is positioned within the Solid ecosystem.
<!-- Findings     -->
The server supports many orthogonal feature combinations
on axes such as authorization, authentication and data storage,
and is fully compliant with the Solid specifications.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
The Community Solid Server lowers the entrance barrier to Solid.
It comes with several predefined configurations that allow developers
to quickly set up a server with different content and backends,
and can easily be modified to change many of its features.
<!-- Perspectives -->
The server will evolve together with the specification,
and we are still continuing work on adding more features that might be useful for the community,
such as adding support for cross-document queries.
