## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Solid servers provide the API through which clients interface with user data.
<!-- Need         -->
Due to the diverse nature of interests in Solid,
there are many features requested from servers.
<!-- Task         -->
To meet these demands,
we have created the Solid Community server,
a modular server that can be configured to suit many needs.
<!-- Object       -->
In this paper we give an overview of the server architecture,
and how it is situated in the Solid ecosystem.
<!-- Findings     -->
Currently, there are already many parties interested in the server
and how it evolves.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
The server achieves it goal of lowering the barrier of getting started with Solid.
<!-- Perspectives -->
It will evolve together with the specification and new needs that arise.
