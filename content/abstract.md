## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">We're gonna need a bit more context here ðŸ™‚ Proposal: how Linked Data has a strong association with public data, but that it actually also can be used for private data and everything in between. That's the idea behind Solid: empower people and organisations with permissioned decentralized knowledge graphs.</span>
Solid servers provide the API through which clients interface with user data.
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">Also: Solid is a spec.</span>
<!-- Need         -->
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">There is a need for R&D on top of Solid Pods. So just enterprise implementations of the spec won't cut it. Need for modularity should be evident, so the task flows into it.</span>
Due to the diverse nature of interests in Solid,
there are many features requested from servers.
<!-- Task         -->
To meet these demands,
we have created the Solid Community server,
a modular server that can be configured to suit many needs.
<!-- Object       -->
In this paper we give an overview of the server architecture,
and how it is situated within the Solid ecosystem.
<!-- Findings     -->
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">This is a hard one for a systems paper indeed; but we could describe some concrete cases here where the modularity has been leveraged.</span>
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">Spec-compliant solution, passes test suites.</span>
Currently, there are already many parties interested in the server
and how it evolves.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">Ready for use in scenarios X and Y.</span>
The server achieves it goal of lowering the barrier of getting started with Solid.
<!-- Perspectives -->
It will evolve together with the specification and new needs that arise.
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">Concrete needs include query.</span>
